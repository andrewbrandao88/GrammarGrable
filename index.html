            <p class="text-center">Grammar Grable strives to solve the “one-size-fits-all” teaching style 
                that tends to leave some students behind. Not everyone can be taught the same, so our game 
                is another way to learn with intrinsic motivation. Our goal is to create an engaging, 
                teacher supported tool that transforms mandatory boring curriculum into a fun desirable 
                learning level-based vocabulary adventure game.

            <p class="text-center"> Grammar Grable is a puzzle based educational game designed to help improve 
                students' vocabulary. Inspired by Escape Room style games, players must solve problems using 
                key items to escape the room and complete each level.  Players don't just read, they interact 
                with the puzzle to learn grade 4-6 reading concepts. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-center">
                Grammar Grable is a 2D top-down style game meant for either personal time or classroom settings. 
                The main goal of the game play is to retrieve all the items that correspond to vocabulary words 
                and get to the door. When the player interacts with the door, they will be prompted to a definition 
                in which they will have to select the corresponding vocabulary word within their inventory. While 
                you are gathering the items, an enemy is chasing you attempting to catch you before you collect 
                all the items and get to the door. If the enemy gets you a certain number of times, you will fail 
                and need to restart.
