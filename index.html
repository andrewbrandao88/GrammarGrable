        In everyday life people communciate and should communicate with proper lingistic skills. Our project
        aims to help develop reading skills in students in an engaging and applicable way.</p>
        <h2 class="text-center">Description</h2>
        <p class="text-center"> Students will play as Dajan, a student at the boarding school Lowell School of Technical Greatness, 
            trying to sneak out of the dorms. To achieve this, players will walk around finding answers, keys, 
            to solve a poetic riddle to help their reading and comprehension skills, needing to discern the correct 
            answer for the correct key. </p>
